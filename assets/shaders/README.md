# Shaders Directory

You can change the shaders' code such as `PostProcessing` to change how the game gets rendered

The directory structure must be like this:
```ruby
ShaderName
  ShaderName.vert
  ShaderName.frag
```
You don't need to have both the vertex and fragment shader at the same time.

Game Shaders: `PostProcessing`, `World`, `GUI`, `Skybox`, and `Entity`

You can reload the game shaders using `/ + U`
